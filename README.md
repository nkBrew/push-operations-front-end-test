## Push Operations Front End Hiring Test

This is my submission for the Front End hiring test at Push Operations.

### Running the Project

To run the project locally, first clone or download the repo run:

`npm install`

followed by:

`npm run dev`

### Notes

- I used nvm and node version 20.7 to build the project.

- I used pure css rather than setting up tailwind or StyledComponents partially to reduce setup time, but also because I wanted to follow the mockups as close as possible

- Vite was used to bootstrap the project
